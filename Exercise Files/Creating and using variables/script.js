// to play with how this works open up the console in browser and through in a b or sum


// you can create individual variables like so:

var a = 13;
var b = 8;
var sum = a + b;

// or create a single variable like so which (commas denot different variables ) acheives the same thing:

// var a, b, sum; 
// a = 22;
// b = 7;
// sum = a + b;


// or create them all at once (which is much harder to read with a whole bunch of variables)

// var a = 5,  b = 4, sum = a + b;
